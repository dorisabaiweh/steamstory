<h2>How does the News Cafe work?</h2>

<p>The News Café is meant to offer individuals news stories via engaging dialogue. The news stories will be told by the café employees. And our customers, receivers of the news will engage in dialogue with our employees about the information they have just received. News Café is meant the address the problem of passive receiving of news. We want to offer a space where you not only learn about news, but also where you are more engrossed in it via discourse. Further more, we believe news can be a medium for socializing. Not only will you talk to our employees about the news, you are also able to mingle with other news enthusiasts in the café.</p>
<p>The News café is executed in three simple steps. If interested in coming into the cafe, our guest will are expected to send us a text stating when they would like to come in. One of our staffers will then respond via text confirming the reservation and stating the news of the day. We will then send a link to the news article, expecting our guest to read and bring in questions or topics related to the article, that they would like to discuss. When our quests arrive, they'll be expected to check in so we know they are present. After checking in, one of our baristas (whom will be well versed on the news of the day) will meet the guest at his/her table, ready to engage in discourse. </p>
<p>Our goal is for the News Cafe to offer not only a didactic experience, but also bring how individual receive news to a new level—in hopes that we can aid in creating a deeper understanding of news stories.</p>
